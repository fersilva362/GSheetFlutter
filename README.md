# HayEquipo

Here, I show a web & mobile app that retrieves data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The project was inspired by a project that [Gonzalo Pozzo](https://links.gonzalopozzo.com/) had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The idea is to use an uploaded spreadsheet file on Google Drive containing info of soccer matchs in columns (date|team 1|goalsTeam1|team 2|goalsTeam2). The file is loaded by the app and used to create a new squad of players.<br/>
I built two version, one written with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and the other with [React](https://reactjs.org/).<br/>

The flutter version implementes the MVC architecture design pattern and [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) state management.

The Ract version implements react-router to handle routing and [bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) to syle the app.
