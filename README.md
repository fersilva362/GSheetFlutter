# HayEquipo

A Web|Mobile App that retrieves data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The project was inspired by a project that [Gonzalo Pozzo](https://links.gonzalopozzo.com/) had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The idea is that use an uploaded spreadsheet file on Google Drive with info of soccer results in columns (date|team 1|goalsTeam1|team 2|goalsTeam2). the file is loaded by the app and used to create a new squad.
I built two version, one written with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and the other with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The flutter version implementes the MVC architecture design pattern.
