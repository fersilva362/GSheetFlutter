Here, I show a web & mobile app that retrieves data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The project was inspired by a project that [Gonzalo Pozzo](https://links.gonzalopozzo.com/) had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The idea is to integrate GoogleSheet to a framework (React or Flutter),  and the first step start by using an spreadsheet file on Google Drive where each soccer match event contains information about(date|team 1|goalsTeam1|team 2|goalsTeam2). The file is  loaded by fetching a *.tsv file in the app and then I use the response to create a new squad of players.<br/>
I built two version, one written with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and other with [React](https://reactjs.org/).<br/>

The flutter version implementes the MVC architecture design pattern and [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) state management.

The ReactJS version implements [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle routing and [ReactBootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) to syle the app.
