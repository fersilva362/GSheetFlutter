# HayEquipo

A Web|Mobile App that retrieves data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The project was inspired by a project that Gonzalo Pozzo had done a few weeks ago using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).
I built two version coded with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and other with[React](https://reactjs.org/)
